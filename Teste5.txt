1. Firstly, get a bowl, and a head of lettuce. Make sure you wash the lettuce well. Break the leaves off, and rub the lettuce under cold water. Then dry.

2. After that, add some veggies that you like! Wash and chop up a few to throw in with the salad. Try to mix interesting flavors, such as tomatoes, celery, and herbs (fresh is best).

3. Go even further with some meat. If you want a salad with some extra protein, add some chopped pieces of turkey lunch meat or other meats.

4. Want to keep the salad vegetarian? Add some tofu or seitan chunks, and walnuts are good for any salad, meat-free or not.

5. Then mix all of your ingredients into the bowl and stir together. Add your favorite dressing.

6. Finally, serve. It's the easy, healthy, and tasty snack full of crunchy and chewy ingredients.
